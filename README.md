- The website is mobile first and responsive.
- Animation triggers on HTML elements on mouse scroll.

## Improvements
- The site can be more dynamic in animation and can take inspiration from awwwards.com websites.
- Contact Form will not work on GH pages as it doesn't not accept server side functions and methods.
